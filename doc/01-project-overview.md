# Project Overview

**File:** `/doc/01-project-overview.md`

## 1. Project Purpose

Ogera is a student-employer platform designed to connect students with employment and work opportunities while providing employers with tools to manage jobs, applications, assigned work, communication, and payments.

The backend provides the secure API and business logic required to support the platform. It handles authentication, authorization, job and application workflows, academic verification, trust-related functionality, disputes, payments, notifications, file access, and other platform operations.

The system is intended to provide a structured environment where students can discover and complete work opportunities while employers can recruit and manage student workers.

## 5. Major Workflows

### 5.1 Registration and Authentication

1. A user registers as a student or employer.
2. Required contact information is verified.
3. The user authenticates with the platform.
4. The backend creates and manages the authenticated session.
5. Access and refresh authentication mechanisms are used according to the configured authentication flow.
6. Authorization rules determine which resources the user can access.

### 5.2 Profile and Trust Workflow

1. A student or employer completes their profile.
2. Supporting information and permitted documents may be uploaded.
3. Relevant academic, professional, assessment, referral, or peer-review information is recorded.
4. Trust-related data is calculated or maintained according to the platform's trust functionality.

### 5.3 Job and Application Workflow

1. An employer creates a job.
2. The job becomes available according to its configured status and access rules.
3. Students discover and review available jobs.
4. A student submits an application.
5. The employer reviews submitted applications.

## 6. System Boundaries

The Ogera backend is responsible for:

- HTTP API endpoints.
- Authentication.
- Authorization and permission enforcement.
- Business logic.
- Feature modules.
- Database access.
- Database migrations and seeders.
- File-upload handling and access control.
- Scheduled backend jobs.
- Notifications.
- Realtime Socket.IO events.
- Integration with external services.
- API-level validation and error handling.

The React frontend is a separate client application that consumes the backend APIs.

The backend does not own the implementation of the React user interface.

PostgreSQL and external service providers are dependencies of the backend rather than components owned entirely by the application.

---

## 7. External Services

Ogera integrates with or depends on external services for specific platform capabilities.

These include:

| Service | Purpose |
|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | Primary relational database |
| SMTP / Nodemailer | Email delivery |
| Twilio | SMS communication |
| Cloudinary | Cloud-based file/media storage |
| S3-compatible storage | Object/document storage |
| Pesapal | Payment processing |
| Mobile-money providers | Payment processing |
| Axios | HTTP communication with external services |
| Socket.IO | Realtime communication |

External service credentials and secrets must be provided through environment configuration and must not be committed to source control or documentation.

---

## 8. Project Ownership

Ogera is part of the Sybella project ecosystem.

Project ownership, deployment ownership, production infrastructure ownership, and operational contacts should be maintained by the responsible Sybella project/deployment owners.

The canonical production owner and escalation contacts should be confirmed with the project owner before being added to this document.

Technical ownership is divided according to the project's frontend, backend, database, infrastructure, and operational responsibilities.

---

## 9. Environment Information

### 9.1 Local Development

The backend supports local development using:

- Node.js.
- TypeScript.
- Express.
- PostgreSQL.
- Sequelize.

The local backend development server uses port:

```text
5000
```

The frontend is a separate React application and communicates with the backend through its configured API URL.

### 9.2 Environment Configuration

Environment-specific values are configured through environment variables.

Configuration may include:

- Server URL and port.
- Database connection information.
- JWT configuration.
- Frontend origin.
- Email configuration.
- SMS configuration.
- Storage configuration.
- Payment provider configuration.
- Cloud-service credentials.

Secrets must never be hard-coded into application source code or committed to the repository.

### 9.3 Development, Staging, and Production

Development, staging, and production environments may use different infrastructure and configuration.

Canonical hosting details, production domains, deployment infrastructure, and environment ownership require confirmation from the deployment owner and should be maintained as deployment documentation once confirmed.

## 10. Current Development Status

Ogera is currently under active development.

The backend already contains major platform functionality covering:

- Authentication and authorization.
- User and profile management.
- Jobs and job applications.
- Tasks.
- Academic records and verification workflows.
- Trust-related functionality.
- Referrals and peer reviews.
- Notifications and communication.
- Disputes and evidence.
- Assessments and courses.
- Payment and transaction integrations.
- Administrative functionality.
- Analytics and reporting.

The frontend and backend continue to evolve as new platform functionality and improvements are implemented.

Because the project is actively developed, this document should be updated when there are significant changes to the project's purpose, business workflows, system boundaries, external dependencies, environments, ownership, or development status.
